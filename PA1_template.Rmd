## Loading and preprocessing the data
List of the steps that are performed are :
1. Read the data
2. Sum the number of steps taken in a day while removing NA
3. Plot the histogram of the total number of steps every day
```{r preprocess}
rawData <- read.csv("./activity/activity.csv")
totalSteps <- tapply(X = rawData$steps, INDEX = rawData$date, FUN = sum, na.rm  = TRUE)
barplot(totalSteps)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
